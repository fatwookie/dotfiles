# My repo of dotfiles

This is my collection of dotfiles to build a sane shell environment. 

## Prerequisites

Just run:

```
sudo apt update -y ; sudo apt install -y fish invoke curl
wget https://github.com/dandavison/delta/releases/download/0.4.4/git-delta_0.4.4_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i git-delta_0.4.4_amd64.deb

```

To deploy, just copy the files to their respective locations.

*Warning!* 

This overwrites all existing copies of the equivalent files in this repo. Use with care!
